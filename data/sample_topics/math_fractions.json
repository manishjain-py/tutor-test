    "common_misconceptions": [
      "Larger denominator means larger fraction",
      "Adding fractions by adding numerators and denominators separately",
      "Thinking 1/4 is bigger than 1/2 because 4 > 2"
    ],
    "teaching_approach": "Teach fractions as equal parts of one whole before using symbols. Start with a simple visual or real-life sharing situation and confirm the child understands the whole is split into equal parts. Introduce fraction notation a/b only after the idea is clear. Keep language simple and repeatedly connect symbols back to the visual/story. Proactively address misconceptions: more parts means smaller parts (so bigger denominator does not automatically mean bigger fraction), and when adding same-denominator fractions you add numerators only because part size stays the same. Use short, frequent checks and ask the student to explain reasoning in their own words. If the student struggles, return to visuals and equal-part reasoning. Progress from concrete models to drawings to numbers-only practice."

Use a simple visual or real-life sharing situation to introduce 'one whole' and 'equal parts'. Confirm the student can identify the whole and the equal parts. Avoid locking into a single example; pick an age-appropriate example the child relates to."

Briefly surface the misconception that 'bigger denominator means bigger fraction' and correct it using the idea that more parts makes each part smaller."
