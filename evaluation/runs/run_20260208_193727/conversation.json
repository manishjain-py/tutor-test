Every time you share a pizza, you're already doing fractions.\n\nHere's how it works: a fraction is just a way of showing **a part of a whole thing**. It has two numbers:\n\n- The **top number** (called the **numerator**) tells you how many parts you're talking about.\n- The **bottom number** (called the **denominator**) tells you how many **equal** parts the whole thing was split into.\n\nSo if you cut a cookie in half and grab one piece, that's **1** on top (you took one piece) and **2** on the bottom (there were 2 equal pieces). That gives you the fraction **\u00bd**! \ud83c\udf6a\n\nNow let's see what you've got! Here's a question for you:\n\n**Imagine you cut a pizza into 8 equal slices and you eat 3 of them. What fraction of the pizza did you eat?** And can you tell me what the top number and the bottom number each mean in your answer? \ud83c\udf55\n\nGive it a try \u2014 I bet you'll nail it! \ud83d\ude04",
