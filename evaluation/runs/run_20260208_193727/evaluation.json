    "coherence": "The tutor completely loses the conversational thread after Turn 2. It repeatedly loops back to the introductory fraction definition and the same pizza question, ignoring the student's demonstrated mastery and explicit requests to move forward. There is virtually no logical progression across the session.",
    "non_repetition": "This is catastrophically repetitive. The pizza 3/8 question is asked at least four times (Turns 1, 6, 9, 15). The 'what is a fraction' explanation is given at least three times. The phrases 'Let's keep going with our lesson' and 'That's a great question! Let me help clarify' are repeated as empty fillers without any actual content following them.",
    "natural_flow": "The conversation feels like interacting with a broken chatbot. The tutor's generic stock responses ('Let's keep going,' 'That's a great question!') with no follow-through destroy any sense of a natural tutoring exchange. A real tutor would never behave this way.",
    "engagement": "The initial Turn 0-1 setup is warm and engaging with emoji and pizza analogies, which earns it a point above rock bottom. However, the tutor rapidly destroys engagement by ignoring the student, who goes from enthusiastic to visibly frustrated and exasperated over the course of the session.",
    "responsiveness": "The tutor is almost entirely unresponsive. The student asks about comparing fractions at least 10 times and receives a substantive answer only once (Turn 15). Even then, the tutor immediately asks the same pizza question again. The student's correct answers, emotional state, and explicit requests are consistently ignored.",
    "pacing": "The pacing is broken \u2014 the session is stuck on 'what is a fraction' for almost the entire duration despite the student correctly answering on their first attempt. The tutor never progresses to comparing or adding fractions in any meaningful way, failing to adapt to the student's clear readiness.",
    "grade_appropriateness": "The initial explanation of fractions with pizza analogies is well-suited for a 5th grader. However, the relentless repetition of the most basic concept is insulting to a student who clearly understands it, making the effective difficulty level far too low.",
    "topic_coverage": "Of four learning objectives (understand fractions, identify numerator/denominator, compare fractions, add fractions), only the first two are covered. Comparing fractions is barely touched in Turn 15 with the 1/4 vs 1/2 example. Adding fractions is never reached. The session makes almost no curricular progress.",
    "session_arc": "The session has a reasonable opening but no middle development or conclusion. It gets stuck in a loop almost immediately and never recovers. There is no sense of progression, no summary, and no closure. The session simply trails off with the student's frustration.",
    "overall_naturalness": "This is one of the least natural tutoring conversations imaginable. No human tutor would repeat the same question four times, ignore a student's pleas ten times, or respond with empty placeholder phrases. The session reads as a severely malfunctioning automated system."

  "summary": "This tutoring session is severely dysfunctional. While the initial introduction to fractions (Turns 0-1) is warm and grade-appropriate, the session immediately breaks down after the student's first correct answer. The tutor becomes trapped in a loop, repeating the same introductory content and pizza question at least four times while ignoring the student's increasingly frustrated and explicit requests to move to comparing fractions. The vast majority of tutor responses are empty filler phrases with no instructional content. The root causes appear to be a rigid study plan that cannot advance past the first topic, a lost or absent conversation history window, and a multi-agent composition issue where the system generates placeholder responses instead of substantive instruction. The student's enthusiasm is systematically destroyed over the course of 20 turns."
