We're going to explore fractions, which is really just a cool way of talking about splitting things up, like sharing a pizza with your friends or dividing up points in a game. By the end, you'll know how to read fractions, compare them, and even add them together, so are you ready to jump in?",

A fraction is really just a way of showing **parts of a whole**. It has two numbers:\n\n- The **bottom number** (called the **denominator**) tells you how many **equal slices** the pizza is cut into.\n- The **top number** (called the **numerator**) tells you how many **slices you have**.\n\nSo when you say **1/2**, the bottom number (2) means the pizza was cut into **2 equal slices**, and the top number (1) means you have **1 of those slices**. \ud83c\udf55\n\nPretty simple, right? You were already thinking about it the right way!\n\nNow here's a question for you: Imagine a pizza is cut into **4 equal slices**, and you grab **3** of them.
