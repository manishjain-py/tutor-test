### [Turn 0] TUTOR

Hi there! Today we’re going to learn about fractions—like sharing pizza slices or splitting points in a game. You’ll learn what a fraction means, find the numerator and denominator, compare fractions with the same bottom number, and add them too. Are you ready to begin?

### [Turn 1] STUDENT

Yeah! I love pizza and games, so that sounds fun. Let's do it!

### [Turn 1] TUTOR

Awesome—let’s use pizza and games!

A **fraction** shows **part of a whole**. Imagine a pizza cut into **8 equal slices**. If you eat **3 slices**, you ate **3 out of 8** parts of the whole pizza. We write that as **3/8**.

- The **top number** (numerator) tells how many parts you have (or ate).
- The **bottom number** (denominator) tells how many **equal parts** the whole is split into.

Now try this: **A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. Maya eats 3 slices. What fraction of the pizza did Maya eat?**

### [Turn 2] STUDENT

Hmm, I think Maya ate 3/8 of the pizza. Right?

### [Turn 2] TUTOR

You’re very close! **For this pizza problem, 3/8 is correct** because the pizza is cut into **8 equal slices** and Maya ate **3 of them**.

Also, remember what a **fraction** means:
- The **bottom number (denominator)** tells how many **equal parts** the whole is split into (8 slices).
- The **top number (numerator)** tells how many parts you have or ate (3 slices).

So Maya ate **3 out of 8** slices, which is **3/8**.

Now you try: If a pizza is cut into **10 equal slices** and Maya eats **4 slices**, what fraction did she eat?

### [Turn 3] STUDENT

I think she ate 4/10 of the pizza.

### [Turn 3] TUTOR

You’re thinking about fractions the right way—**a fraction tells how many equal parts we have out of the whole**. In a fraction, the **top number (numerator)** is how many parts are taken, and the **bottom number (denominator)** is how many equal parts the whole is split into.

Here, the pizza is cut into **8 equal slices**, and Maya ate **3 slices**, so the fraction she ate is **3/8** (not 4/10).

So, **what fraction of the pizza did Maya eat?**

### [Turn 4] STUDENT

Oops, I got mixed up! Maya ate 3/8 of the pizza.

### [Turn 4] TUTOR

3/8 is the **right fraction** for this pizza problem—nice job!

A **fraction** tells how much of a whole you have when it’s split into **equal parts**.  
- The **denominator** (bottom number) tells how many equal parts the whole is cut into.  
- The **numerator** (top number) tells how many parts are taken.

So if the pizza is cut into **8** equal slices and Maya eats **3** slices, she ate **3/8** of the pizza.

Can you tell me: in **3/8**, what does the **8** mean, and what does the **3** mean?

### [Turn 5] STUDENT

The **8** means the whole pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. The **3** means 3 slices were eaten.

### [Turn 5] TUTOR

You’ve got it! The **8** tells us the pizza is split into **8 equal** slices, and the **3** tells us **3 of those slices** were eaten. So Maya ate **3/8** of the pizza.

Now answer this: **A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. Maya eats 3 slices. What fraction of the pizza did Maya eat?**

### [Turn 6] STUDENT

Maya ate 3/8 of the pizza!

### [Turn 6] TUTOR

You used the fraction **3/8** in a great way! **3/8** means **3 out of 8 equal parts** of a whole pizza.

A **fraction** is a number that shows **part of a whole** (or part of a group). The **top number** (numerator) tells **how many parts you have**, and the **bottom number** (denominator) tells **how many equal parts the whole is split into**.

Now try this: **A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. Sam eats 3 slices. What fraction of the pizza did Sam eat?**

### [Turn 7] STUDENT

Sam ate 3/8 of the pizza.

### [Turn 7] TUTOR

Nice example! “Sam ate 3/8 of the pizza” uses a fraction the right way: it means Sam ate **3 pieces out of 8 equal pieces**.

To answer “What is a fraction?” you can say: **A fraction shows part of a whole that is split into equal parts.** The **top number** (numerator) tells how many parts you have, and the **bottom number** (denominator) tells how many equal parts the whole is split into.

Can you try writing one sentence that **defines** a fraction in your own words?

### [Turn 8] STUDENT

A fraction is a number that shows how much of something we have, like pizza slices, out of a whole.

### [Turn 8] TUTOR

You’re right! A fraction shows a part of a whole, and your pizza slices example is a great way to picture it.

To make your definition even stronger, you can say that a fraction is written like **numerator/denominator**:
- The **denominator** (bottom number) tells how many **equal parts** the whole is cut into.
- The **numerator** (top number) tells how many parts you have.

Now try this: **A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. Maya eats 3 slices. What fraction of the pizza did Maya eat?**

### [Turn 9] STUDENT

Maya ate 3/8 of the pizza!
