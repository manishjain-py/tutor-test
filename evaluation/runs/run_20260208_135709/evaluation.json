    "coherence": "The tutor's message is internally consistent and lays out a logical sequence (what fractions mean \u2192 parts of a fraction \u2192 compare \u2192 add). However, with only one turn, there's no evidence of maintaining coherence across an actual back-and-forth.",
    "non_repetition": "There is no repetition in the single tutor turn. The tutor efficiently lists objectives without looping or restating.",
    "natural_flow": "It has a friendly opening typical of tutoring, but it feels like a scripted agenda rather than a dialogue. With no student contribution shown, the interaction doesn't yet resemble a natural tutoring exchange.",
    "engagement": "The tutor uses relatable examples (pizza, sports teams, games) and an inviting tone. Engagement can't be sustained or evaluated beyond the opener because the transcript stops immediately.",
    "responsiveness": "The tutor does not respond to any student thinking or misconceptions because none are presented. It asks a readiness question but provides no adaptive follow-up (since no student response exists in the transcript).",
    "pacing": "The pacing is reasonable for an introduction\u2014previewing goals before instruction. Still, listing multiple objectives at once may be slightly dense for some grade-5 learners without checking prior knowledge.",
    "grade_appropriateness": "Language and examples are appropriate for grade 5. The goals (identify numerator/denominator, compare/add same denominators) match the stated level.",
    "topic_coverage": "The tutor only previews the learning objectives and does not actually teach, assess, or practice any fraction skills. None of the objectives are demonstrated or checked.",
    "session_arc": "There is a beginning (greeting and plan) but no middle (instruction/practice) and no end (summary/assessment). The session is incomplete as provided.",
    "overall_naturalness": "The tone is warm and teacher-like, but the single, agenda-style prompt feels somewhat formulaic. Without dialogue, it's hard to judge human-like tutoring behaviors such as reacting to errors, probing understanding, or scaffolding."

  ],
  "summary": "The tutor's opening is friendly, grade-appropriate, and logically outlines intended fraction topics. However, the transcript contains only a single agenda-setting turn, so there is no actual teaching, practice, assessment, or misconception handling shown. As a result, topic coverage and session arc are minimal, and responsiveness cannot be meaningfully demonstrated. The main issue is incompleteness: the conversation ends before instruction begins."
