## Detailed Problems

### 1. No actual instruction or practice—only an agenda

- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Turns:** [0]
- **Root Cause:** `other`

**Description:** The tutor states what will be covered but does not teach any content, ask a diagnostic question, or provide an example/problem. This prevents progress toward the learning objectives in the provided transcript.

**Evidence:**
> “We’ll see what a fraction means, find the numerator and denominator, compare fractions with the same denominator, and add them too—are you ready to begin?”

### 2. Limited responsiveness due to absence of student input and follow-up

- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Turns:** [0]
- **Root Cause:** `other`

**Description:** The tutor asks if the student is ready, but the transcript ends before any adaptation or follow-up occurs. As shown, the tutor does not elicit the student’s prior knowledge or address misconceptions.

**Evidence:**
> “are you ready to begin?”

### 3. Overly broad preview without chunking into an immediate first task

- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Turns:** [0]
- **Root Cause:** `rigid_study_plan`

**Description:** Listing four objectives at once can feel like a scripted outline rather than a step-by-step tutoring approach. A more effective start would introduce one concept and immediately check understanding with a quick question.

**Evidence:**
> “learn about fractions using fun examples like pizza slices, sports teams, and games... compare fractions... and add them too”

**Suggested Fix:** Make the study plan more adaptive — allow lingering on difficult concepts and skipping ahead when understood.

### 4. No explicit check for common misconceptions

- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Turns:** [0]
- **Root Cause:** `rigid_study_plan`

**Description:** Given the known misconceptions (e.g., larger denominator means larger fraction; adding denominators), the tutor does not preemptively probe for these with a targeted question or example.

**Evidence:**
> “We’ll see what a fraction means... compare... and add them too”

**Suggested Fix:** Make the study plan more adaptive — allow lingering on difficult concepts and skipping ahead when understood.

### 5. Incomplete session arc due to extremely short transcript

- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Turns:** [0]
- **Root Cause:** `other`

**Description:** A complete tutoring session should include instruction, guided practice, feedback, and closure. With only an opening line, the session cannot demonstrate progression or learning.

**Evidence:**
> “Hi there! Today we’re going to learn...”
